# Perceptual Colour Models for 3D Gaussian Splatting 
Our implementation builds on Safeguard Gaussian Splatting's open-source code, which includes comparative models like LightGaussian, Mini-Splatting, and RadSplat. Inspired by SafeguardGSâ€™s simple yet effective integration of score functions into a CUDA-differentiable 3DGS rasterizer, we extended this framework by exploring new score functions. We conducted training using a single NVIDIA A100 80GB, maintaining consistent iteration parameters, learning rates, and densification methods from the original 3DGS. For fair comparison, we standardized the loss function across all models, using a hybrid of Huber loss and D-SSIM.

### Implementation guide

1. Clone this repository

2. Set up the conda environment.
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ColourGS
```

3. Train and evaluate the model for the bicycle scene in mipnerf360. 
```shell
python train.py -s data/mipnerf360/bicycle -m output/mipnerf360/bicycle --prune_method safeguard_gs --eval # pruning method: safeguard_gs
```
